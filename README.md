## Introduction
"It's About Time" is a groundbreaking decentralized P2P labor marketplace built on the Worldcoin platform leveraging the zkBob privacy application and Polygon blockchain. It allows anyone - including bots and AI - to buy time from a real person with a Worldcoin ID. This not only adds significant value to the Worldcoin network but also brings a novel use case to the blockchain space. Additionally, we are pursuing prizes from those platforms.

## Features
- Create Listings: Users can list their skills along with a set hourly rate and a detailed description of the service they provide.
- Review and Purchase: Buyers can browse through listings and purchase services based on the listed hourly rates.
- Worldcoin Integration: Utilizes Worldcoin's 'proof of personhood' identification protocol, ensuring a secure and decentralized user experience.
- zkBob Integration: We leverage zkBob's Direct Deposit functionality, allowing private transactions directly to the receiver's zkBob address.
- Secure and Cost-Effective Transactions: The marketplace benefits from the use of the Polygon blockchain, which enables fast and affordable transactions.
